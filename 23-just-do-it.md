# Just Do It!  

Just keep breathing in and out like this. Don’t be interested in anything
else. It doesn’t matter even if someone is standing on their head with
their arse in the air. Don’t pay it any attention. Just stay with the inbreath
and the out-breath. Concentrate your awareness on the breath.
Just keep doing it.  

Don’t take up anything else. There’s no need to think about gaining
things. Don’t take up anything at all. Simply know the in- breath and the
out-breath. The in-breath and the out-breath. Bud on the in-breath; dho on
the out-breath. Just stay with the breath in this way until you are aware
of the in-breath and aware of the out-breath, aware of the in-breath and
aware of the out-breath. Be aware in this way until the mind is peaceful,
without irritation, without agitation, merely the breath going out and
coming in. Let your mind remain in this state. You don’t need a goal yet.
This state is the first stage of practice.

If the mind is at ease, if it’s at peace, it will be naturally aware. As you
keep doing it, the breath diminishes, becomes softer. The body becomes
pliable, the mind becomes pliable. It’s a natural process. Sitting is
comfortable: you’re not dull, you don’t nod, you’re not sleepy. The mind
has a natural fluency about whatever it does. It is still. It is at peace. And
then when you leave the samādhi, you say to yourself, ‘Wow, what was
that?’ You recall the peace that you’ve just experienced. And you never
forget it.

The things which follows along with us are called sati, the power of
recollection, and sampajañña, self-awareness. Whatever we say or do,
wherever we go, on almsround or whatever, in eating the meal, washing
our almsbowl, then be aware of what it’s all about. Be constantly
mindful. Follow the mind.

When you’re practising walking meditation (cankama), have a walking
path, say from one tree to another, about fifty feet in length. Walking
cankama is the same as sitting meditation. Focus your awareness: ‘now, I
am going to put forth effort. With strong recollection and self-awareness
I am going to pacify my mind.’ The object of concentration depends on
the person. Find what suits you. Some people spread mettā to all sentient
beings and then leading with their right foot, walk at a normal pace,
using the mantra ‘Buddho’ in conjunction with the walking, continually
being aware of that object. If the mind becomes agitated, stop, calm the
mind and then resume walking, constantly self-aware. Aware at the
beginning of the path, aware at every stage of the path, the beginning,
the middle and the end. Make this knowing continuous.

This is a method, focusing on walking cankama. Walking cankama means
walking to and fro. It’s not easy. Some people see us walking up and
down and think we’re crazy. They don’t realize that walking cankama
gives rise to great wisdom. Walk to and fro. If you’re tired then stand
and still your mind. Focus on making the breathing comfortable. When it
is reasonably comfortable then switch the attention to walking again.
The postures change by themselves. Standing, walking, sitting, lying
down. They change. We can’t just sit all the time, stand all the time or lie
down all the time. Because we have to spend our time with these
different postures, make all four postures beneficial. This is the action.
We just keep doing it. It’s not easy.

To make it easy to visualise, take this glass and set it down here for two
minutes. When the two minutes are up, then move it over there for two
minutes. Then move it over here for two minutes. Keep doing that. Do it
again and again until you start to suffer, until you doubt, until wisdom
arises. ‘What am I thinking about, lifting a glass backwards and forwards
like a madman.’ The mind will think in its habitual way according to the
phenomena. It doesn’t matter what anyone says. Just keep lifting that
glass. Every two minutes, okay - don’t daydream, not five minutes. As
soon as two minutes are up then move it over here. Focus on that. This is
the matter of action.

Looking at the in-breaths and out-breaths is the same. Sit with your right
foot resting on your left leg, sit straight, watch the inhalation to its full
extent until it completely disappears in the abdomen. When the
inhalation is complete then allow the breath out until the lungs are
empty. Don’t force it. It doesn’t matter how long or short or soft the
breath is; let it be just right for you. Sit and watch the inhalation and the
exhalation, make yourself comfortable with that. Don’t allow your mind
to get lost. If it gets lost then stop, look to see where it has got to, why it
is not following the breath. Go after it and bring it back. Get it to stay
with the breath, and, without doubt, one day you will see the reward.
Just keep doing it. Do it as if you won’t gain anything, as if nothing will
happen, as if you don’t know who’s doing it, but keep doing it anyway.
Like rice in the barn. You take it out and sow it in the fields, as if you
were throwing it away. You sow it throughout the fields, without being
interested in it, and yet it sprouts, rice plants grow up. You transplant it
and you’ve got sweet green rice. That’s what it’s about.

This is the same. Just sit there. Sometimes you might think, ‘why am I
watching the breath so intently? Even if I didn’t watch it, it would still
keep going in and out.’

Well, you’ll always finds something to think about. That’s a view. It is an
expression of the mind. Forget it. Keep trying over and over again and
make the mind peaceful.

Once the mind is at peace, the breath will diminish, the body will become
relaxed, the mind will become subtle. They will be in a state of balance
until it will seem as if there is no breath, but nothing happens to you.
When you reach this point, don’t panic, don’t get up and run out,
because you think you’ve stopped breathing. It just means that your
mind is at peace. You don’t have to do anything. Just sit there and look at
whatever is present.

Sometimes you may wonder, ‘Eh, am I breathing?’ This is the same
mistake. It is the thinking mind. Whatever happens, allow things to take
their natural course, no matter what feeling arises. Know it, look at it. But
don’t be deluded by it. Keep doing it, keep doing it. Do it often. After the
meal, air your robe on a line, and get straight out onto the walking
meditation path. Keep thinking Buddho, Buddho. Think it all the time that
you’re walking. Concentrate on the word Buddho as you walk. Wear the
path down, wear it down until it’s a trench and it’s halfway up your
calves, or up to your knees. Just keep walking.

It’s not just strolling along in a perfunctory way, thinking about this and
that for a length of the path, and then going up into your hut and looking
at your sleeping mat, ‘How inviting!’ Then lying down and snoring away
like a pig. If you do that you won’t get anything from the practice at all.
Keep doing it until you’re fed up and then see how far that laziness goes.
Keep looking until you come to the end of laziness. Whatever it is you
experience, you have to go all the way through it before you overcome it.
It’s not as if you can just repeat the word ‘peace’ to yourself and then as
soon as you sit, you expect peace will arise like at the click of a switch,
and when it doesn’t, you give up, lazy. If that’s the case you’ll never be
peaceful.

It’s easy to talk about and hard to do. It’s like monks who are thinking of
disrobing saying, ‘Rice farming doesn’t seem so difficult to me. I’d be
better off as a rice farmer.’ They start farming without knowing about
cows or buffaloes, harrows or ploughs, nothing at all. They find out that
when you talk about farming it sounds easy, but when you actually try it
you get to know exactly what the difficulties are.

Everyone would like to search for peace in that way. Actually, peace
does lie right there, but you don’t know it yet. You can follow after it,
you can talk about it as much as you like, but you won’t know what it is.
So, do it. Follow it until you know in pace with the breath, concentrating
on the breath using the mantra ‘Buddho’. Just that much. Don’t let the
mind wander off anywhere else. At this time have this knowing. Do this.
Study just this much. Just keep doing it, doing it in this way. If you start
thinking that nothing is happening, just carry on anyway. Just carry on
regardless and you will get to know the breath.

Okay, so give it a try! If you sit in this way and the mind gets the hang of
it, the mind will reach an optimum, ‘just right’ state. When the mind is
peaceful the self-awareness arises naturally. Then if you want to sit right
through the night, you feel nothing, because the mind is enjoying itself.
When you get this far, when you’re good at it, then you might find you
want to give Dhamma talks to your friends until the cows come home.
That’s how it goes sometimes.

It’s like the time when Por Sang[^1] was still a postulant. One night he’d
been walking cankama and then began to sit. His mind became lucid and
sharp. He wanted to expound the Dhamma. He couldn’t stop. I heard the
sound of someone teaching over in that bamboo grove, really belting it
out. I thought, ‘Is that someone giving a Dhamma talk, or is it the sound
of someone complaining about something?’ It didn’t stop. So I got my
flashlight and went over to have a look. I was right. There in the bamboo
grove, sitting cross-legged in the light of a lantern, was Por Sang, talking
so fast I couldn’t keep up.

So I called out to him, ‘Por Sang, have you gone crazy?’
He said, ‘I don’t know what it is, I just want to talk the Dhamma. I sit
down and I’ve got to talk, I walk and I’ve got to talk. I’ve just got to
expound the Dhamma all the time. I don’t know where it’s going to end.’
I thought to myself, ‘When people practise the Dhamma there’s no limit
to the things that can happen.’

So keep doing it, don’t stop. Don’t follow your moods. Go against the
grain. Practise when you feel lazy and practise when you feel diligent.
Practise when you’re sitting and practise when you’re walking. When
you lie down, focus on your breathing and tell yourself, ‘I will not
indulge in the pleasure of lying down.’ Teach your heart in this way. Get
up as soon as you awaken, and carry on putting forth effort.
Eating, tell yourself, ‘I eat this food, not with craving, but as medicine, to
sustain my body for a day and a night, only in order that I may continue
my practice.’

When you lie down, teach your mind. When you eat, teach your mind.
Maintain that attitude constantly. If you’re going to stand up, then be
aware of that. If you’re going to lie down, then be aware of that.
Whatever you do, be aware. When you lie down, lie on your right side
and focus on the breath, using the mantra Buddho until you fall asleep.
Then when you wake up it’s as if Buddho has been there all the time, it’s
not been interrupted. For peace to arise, there needs to be mindfulness all
the time. Don’t go looking at other people. Don’t be interested in other
people’s affairs; just be interested in your own affairs.

When you do sitting meditation, sit straight; don’t lean your head too far
back or too far forwards. Keep a balanced ‘just-right’ posture like a
Buddha image. Then your mind will be bright and clear.

Endure; for as long as you can before changing your posture. If it hurts,
let it hurt. Don’t be in a hurry to change your position. Don’t think to
yourself, ‘Oh! It’s too much. Take a rest.’ Patiently endure until the pain
has reached a peak, then endure some more.

Endure, endure until you can’t keep up the mantra ‘Buddho’. Then take
the point where it hurts as your object. ‘Oh! Pain. Pain. Real pain.’ You
can make the pain your meditation object rather than ‘Buddho’. Focus on
it continuously. Keep sitting. When the pain has reached it’s limit, see
what happens.

The Buddha said that pain arises by itself and disappears by itself. Let it
die; don’t give up. Sometimes you may break out in a sweat. Big beads,
as large as corn kernels rolling down your chest. But when you’ve passed
through painful feeling once, then you will know all about it. Keep doing
it. Don’t push yourself too much. Just keep steadily practising.
Be aware while you’re eating. You chew and swallow. Where does the
food go to? Know what foods agree with you and what foods disagree.
Try gauging the amount of food. As you eat, keep looking and when you
think that after another five mouthfuls you’ll be full, stop and drink some
water, and you will have eaten just the right amount. Try it. See whether
or not you can do it. But that’s not the way we usually do it. When we
feel full we take another five mouthfuls. That’s what the mind tells us. It
doesn’t know how to teach itself.

The Buddha told us to keep watching as we eat. Stop five mouthfuls
before you’re full and drink some water and it will be just right. If you sit
or walk afterwards, then you won’t feel heavy. Your meditation will
improve. But we don’t want to do it. We’re full up and we take another
five mouthfuls. That’s the way that craving and defilement is, it goes a
different way from the teachings of the Buddha. Someone who lacks a
genuine wish to train their minds will be unable to do it. Keep watching
your mind.

Be vigilant with sleep. Your success will depend on being aware of the
skilful means. Sometimes the time you go to sleep may vary; some nights
you have an early night and other times a late night. But try practising
like this: whatever time you go to sleep, just sleep at one stretch. As soon
as you wake up, get up immediately. Don’t go back to sleep. Whether
you sleep a lot or a little, just sleep at one stretch. Make a resolution that
as soon as you wake up, even if you haven’t had enough sleep, you will
get up, wash your face, and then start to walk ‘cankama’ or sit meditation.
Know how to train yourself in this way. It’s not something you can know
through listening to someone else. You will know through training
yourself, through practice, through doing it. And so I tell you to practise.

This practice of the heart is difficult. When you are doing sitting
meditation, then let your mind have only one object. Let it stay with the
in-breath and the out-breath and your mind will gradually become calm.
If your mind is in turmoil, then it will have many objects. For instance, as
soon as you sit, do you think of your home? Some people think of eating
Chinese noodles. When you’re first ordained you feel hungry, don’t you?
You want to eat and drink. You think about all kinds of food. Your mind
is going crazy. If that’s what’s going to happen, then let it. But as soon as
you overcome it, then it will disappear.

Do it! Have you ever walked cankama? What was it like as you walked?
Did your mind wander? If it did, then stop and let it come back. If it
wanders off a lot, then don’t breathe. Hold your breath until your lungs
are about to burst. It will come back by itself. No matter how bad it is, if
it’s racing around all over the place, then hold your breath. As your
lungs are about to burst, your mind will return. You must energize the
mind. Training the mind isn’t like training animals. The mind is truly
hard to train. Don’t be easily discouraged. If you hold your breath, you
will be unable to think of anything and the mind will run back to you of
its own accord.

It’s like the water in this bottle. When we tip it out slowly then the water
drips out; drip ... drip ... drip. But when we tip the bottle up farther the
water runs out in a continuous stream, not in separate drops as before.
Our mindfulness is similar. If we accelerate our efforts and practise in an
even, continuous way, mindfulness will be uninterrupted like a stream of
water. No matter whether we are standing, walking, sitting or lying
down, that knowledge is uninterrupted, flowing like a stream of water.

Our practice of the heart is like this. After a moment, it’s thinking of this
and thinking of that. It is agitated and mindfulness is not continuous. But
whatever it thinks about, never mind, just keep putting forth effort. It
will be like the drops of water that become more frequent until they join
up and become a stream. Then our knowledge will be encompassing.
Standing, sitting, walking or laying down, whatever you are doing, this
knowing will look after you.

Start right now. Give it a try. But don’t hurry. If you just sit there
watching to see what will happen, you’ll be wasting your time. So be
careful. If you try too hard, you won’t be successful; but if you don’t try
at all, then you won’t be successful either.
