# Unshakeable Peace

The whole reason for studying the Dhamma, the teachings of the
Buddha, is to search for a way to transcend suffering and attain peace
and happiness. Whether we study physical or mental phenomena, the
mind (citta) or its psychological factors (cetasikā), it’s only when we make
liberation from suffering our ultimate goal that we’re on the right path;
nothing less. Suffering has a cause and conditions for its existence.

Please clearly understand that when the mind is still, it’s in its natural,
normal state. As soon as the mind moves, it becomes conditioned
(sankhāra). When the mind is attracted to something, it becomes
conditioned. When aversion arises, it becomes conditioned. The desire to
move here and there arises from conditioning. If our awareness doesn’t
keep pace with these mental proliferations as they occur, the mind will
chase after them and be conditioned by them. Whenever the mind
moves, at that moment, it becomes a conventional reality.

So the Buddha taught us to contemplate these wavering conditions of the
mind. Whenever the mind moves, it becomes unstable and impermanent
(anicca), unsatisfactory (dukkha) and can not be taken as a self (anattā).
These are the three universal characteristics of all conditioned
phenomena. The Buddha taught us to observe and contemplate these
movements of the mind.

It’s likewise with the teaching of dependent origination (paticcasamuppāda):
deluded understanding (avijjā) is the cause and condition for
the arising of volitional kammic formations (sankhāra); which is the cause
and condition for the arising of consciousness (viññāna); which is the
cause and condition for the arising of mentality and materiality (nāma
and rūpa), and so on, just as we’ve studied in the scriptures. The Buddha
separated each link of the chain to make it easier to study. This is an
accurate description of reality, but when this process actually occurs in
real life, the scholars aren’t able to keep up with what’s happening. It’s
like falling from the top of a tree and crashing down to the ground
below. We have no idea how many branches we’ve passed on the way
down. Similarly, when the mind is suddenly hit by a mental impression,
if it delights in it, then it flies off into a good mood. It considers it good
without being aware of the chain of conditions that led there. The process
takes place in accordance with what is outlined in the theory, but
simultaneously it goes beyond the limits of that theory.

There’s nothing that announces, ‘This is delusion. These are volitional
kammic formations, and that is consciousness.’ The process doesn’t give
the scholars a chance to read out the list as it’s happening. Although the
Buddha analysed and explained the sequence of mind moments in
minute detail, to me it’s more like falling out of a tree. As we come
crashing down there’s no opportunity to estimate how many feet and
inches we’ve fallen. What we do know is that we’ve hit the ground with
a thud and it hurts!

The mind is the same. When it falls for something, what we’re aware of is
the pain. Where has all this suffering, pain, grief, and despair come from?
It didn’t come from theory in a book. There isn’t anywhere where the
details of our suffering are written down. Our pain won’t correspond
exactly with the theory, but the two travel along the same road. So
scholarship alone can’t keep pace with the reality. That’s why the
Buddha taught us to cultivate clear knowing for ourselves. Whatever
arises, arises in this knowing. When that which knows, knows in
accordance with the truth, then the mind and its psychological factors are
recognized as not ours. Ultimately all these phenomena are to be
discarded and thrown away as if they were rubbish. We shouldn’t cling
to or give them any meaning.

## Theory and Reality

The Buddha did not teach about the mind and its psychological factors so
that we’d get attached to the concepts. His sole intention was that we
would recognize them as impermanent, unsatisfactory and not-self. Then
let go. Lay them aside. Be aware and know them as they arise. This mind
has already been conditioned. It’s been trained and conditioned to turn
away and spin out from a state of pure awareness. As it spins it creates
conditioned phenomena which further influence the mind, and the
proliferation carries on. The process gives birth to the good, the evil, and
everything else under the sun. The Buddha taught to abandon it all.
Initially, however, you have to familiarize yourself with the theory in
order that you’ll be able to abandon it all at the later stage. This is a
natural process. The mind is just this way. Psychological factors are just
this way.

Take the Noble Eightfold Path, for example. When wisdom (paññā)
views things correctly with insight, this right view then leads to right
intention, right speech, right action, and so on. This all involves
psychological conditions that have arisen from that pure knowing
awareness. This knowing is like a lantern shedding light on the path
ahead on a dark night. If the knowing is right, if it is in accordance with
truth, it will pervade and illuminate each of the other steps on the path in
turn.

Whatever we experience, it all arises from within this knowing. If this
mind did not exist, the knowing would not exist either. All these are
phenomena of the mind. As the Buddha said, the mind is merely the
mind. It’s not a being, a person, a self, or yourself. It’s neither us nor
them. The Dhamma is simply the Dhamma. It is a natural, selfless
process. It does not belong to us or anyone else. It’s not anything.
Whatever an individual experiences, it all falls within five fundamental
categories (khandhā): body, feeling, memory / perception, thoughts and
consciousness. The Buddha said to let it all go.

Meditation is like a single stick of wood. Insight (vipassanā) is one end of
the stick and serenity (samatha) the other. If we pick it up, does only one
end come up or do both? When anyone picks up a stick both ends rise
together. Which part then is vipassanā, and which is samatha? Where
does one end and the other begin? They are both the mind. As the mind
becomes peaceful, initially the peace will arise from the serenity of
samatha. We focus and unify the mind in states of meditative peace
(samādhi). However, if the peace and stillness of samādhi fades away,
suffering arises in its place. Why is that? Because the peace afforded by
samatha meditation alone is still based on attachment. This attachment
can then be a cause of suffering. Serenity is not the end of the path. The
Buddha saw from his own experience that such peace of mind was not
the ultimate. The causes underlying the process of existence (bhava) had
not yet been brought to cessation (nirodha). The conditions for rebirth still
existed. His spiritual work had not yet attained perfection. Why? Because
there was still suffering. So based on that serenity of samatha he
proceeded to contemplate, investigate, and analyse the conditioned
nature of reality until he was free of all attachments, even the attachment
to serenity. Serenity is still part of the world of conditioned existence and
conventional reality. Clinging to this type of peace is clinging to
conventional reality, and as long as we cling, we will be mired in
existence and rebirth. Delighting in the peace of samatha still leads to
further existence and rebirth. Once the mind’s restlessness and agitation
calms down, one clings to the resultant peace.

So the Buddha examined the causes and conditions underlying existence
and rebirth. As long as he had not yet fully penetrated the matter and
understood the truth, he continued to probe deeper and deeper with a
peaceful mind, reflecting on how all things, peaceful or not, come into
existence. His investigation forged ahead until it was clear to him that
everything that comes into existence is like a lump of red-hot iron. The
five categories of a being’s experience (khandhā) are all a lump of red-hot
iron. When a lump of iron is glowing red-hot, is there anywhere you can
touch it without getting burnt? Is there anywhere at all that is cool? Try
touching it on the top, the sides, or underneath. Is there a single spot that
can be found that’s cool? Impossible. This searing lump of iron is entirely
red-hot. We can’t even attach to serenity. If we identify with that peace,
assuming that there is someone who is calm and serene, this reinforces
the sense that there is an independent self or soul. This sense of self is
part of conventional reality. Thinking, ‘I’m peaceful,’ ‘I’m agitated,’ ‘I’m
good,’ ‘I’m bad,’ ‘I’m happy,’ or ‘I’m unhappy,’ we are caught in more
existence and birth. It’s more suffering. If our happiness vanishes, then
we’re unhappy instead. When our sorrow vanishes, then we’re happy
again. Caught in this endless cycle, we revolve repeatedly through
heaven and hell.

Before his enlightenment, the Buddha recognized this pattern in his own
heart. He knew that the conditions for existence and rebirth had not yet
ceased. His work was not yet finished. Focusing on life’s conditionality,
he contemplated in accordance with nature: ‘Due to this cause there is
birth, due to birth there is death, and all this movement of coming and
going.’ So the Buddha took up these themes for contemplation in order to
understand the truth about the five (khandhā). Everything mental and
physical, everything conceived and thought about, without exception, is
conditioned. Once he knew this, he taught us to set it down. Once he
knew this, he taught to abandon it all. He encouraged others to
understand in accordance with this truth. If we don’t, we’ll suffer. We
won’t be able to let go of these things. However, once we do see the truth
of the matter, we’ll recognize how these things delude us. As the Buddha
taught, ‘The mind has no substance, it’s not anything.’

The mind isn’t born belonging to anyone. It doesn’t die as anyone’s. This
mind is free, brilliantly radiant, and unentangled with any problems or
issues. The reason problems arise is because the mind is deluded by
conditioned things, deluded by this misperception of self. So the Buddha
taught to observe this mind. In the beginning what is there? There is
truly nothing there. It doesn’t arise with conditioned things, and it
doesn’t die with them. When the mind encounters something good, it
doesn’t change to become good. When the mind encounters something
bad, it doesn’t become bad as well. That’s how it is when there is clear
insight into one’s nature. There is understanding that this is essentially a
substance-less state of affairs.

The Buddha’s insight saw it all as impermanent, unsatisfactory and notself.
He wants us to fully comprehend in the same way. The knowing
then knows in accordance with truth. When it knows happiness or
sorrow, it remains unmoved. The emotion of happiness is a form of birth.
The tendency to become sad is a form of death. When there’s death there
is birth, and what is born has to die. That which arises and passes away is
caught in this unremitting cycle of becoming. Once the meditator’s mind
comes to this state of understanding, no doubt remains about whether
there is further becoming and rebirth. There’s no need to ask anyone else.

The Buddha comprehensively investigated conditioned phenomena and
so was able to let it all go. The five khandhas were let go of, and the
knowing carried on merely as an impartial observer of the process. If he
experienced something positive, he didn’t become positive along with it.
He simply observed and remained aware. If he experienced something
negative, he didn’t become negative. And why was that? Because his
mind had been cut free from such causes and conditions. He’d
penetrated the Truth. The conditions leading to rebirth no longer existed.
This is the knowing that is certain and reliable. This is a mind that is truly
at peace. This is what is not born, doesn’t age, doesn’t get sick, and
doesn’t die. This is neither cause nor effect, nor dependent on cause and
effect. It is independent of the process of causal conditioning. The causes
then cease with no conditioning remaining. This mind is above and
beyond birth and death, above and beyond happiness and sorrow, above
and beyond both good and evil. What can you say? It’s beyond the
limitations of language to describe it. All supporting conditions have
ceased and any attempt to describe it will merely lead to attachment. The
words used then become the theory of the mind.

Theoretical descriptions of the mind and its workings are accurate, but
the Buddha realized that this type of knowledge was relatively useless.
We understand something intellectually and then believe it, but it’s of no
real benefit. It doesn’t lead to peace of mind. The knowing of the Buddha
leads to letting go. It results in abandoning and renunciation, because it’s
precisely this mind that leads us to get involved with both what’s right
and what’s wrong. If we’re smart we get involved with those things that
are right. If we’re stupid we get involved with those things that are
wrong. Such a mind is the world, and the Blessed One took the things of
this world to examine this very world. Having come to know the world
as it actually was, he was then known as the ‘One who clearly
comprehends the world’.

Concerning this issue of samatha and vipassanā, the important thing is to
develop these states in our own hearts. Only when we genuinely
cultivate them ourselves will we know what they actually are. We can go
and study what all the books say about psychological factors of the mind,
but that kind of intellectual understanding is useless for actually cutting
off selfish desire, anger, and delusion. We only study the theory about
selfish desire, anger, and delusion, merely describing the various
characteristics of these mental defilements: ‘Selfish desire has this
meaning; anger means that; delusion is defined as this.’ Only knowing
their theoretical qualities, we can talk about them only on that level. We
know and we are intelligent, but when these defilements actually appear
in our minds, do they correspond with the theory or not? When, for
instance, we experience something undesirable do we react and get into a
bad mood? Do we attach? Can we let it go? If aversion comes up and we
recognize it, do we still hang on to it? Or once we have seen it, do we let
it go? If we find that we see something we don’t like and retain that
aversion in our hearts, we’d better go back and start studying again. It’s
still not right. The practice is not yet perfect. When it reaches perfection,
letting go happens. Look at it in this light.

We truly have to look deeply into our own hearts if we want to
experience the fruits of this practice. Attempting to describe the
psychology of the mind in terms of the numerous separate moments of
consciousness and their different characteristics is, in my opinion, not
taking the practice far enough. There’s still a lot more to it. If we are
going to study these things, then we need to know them absolutely, with
clarity and penetrative understanding. Without clarity of insight, how
will we ever be finished with them? There’s no end to it. We’ll never
complete our studies.

Practising Dhamma is thus extremely important. When I practised, that’s
how I studied. I didn’t know anything about mind moments or
psychological factors. I just observed the quality of knowing. If a thought
of hate arose, I asked myself why. If a thought of love arose, I asked
myself why. This is the way. Whether it’s labelled as a thought or called a
psychological factor, so what? Just penetrate this one point until you’re
able to resolve these feelings of love and hate, until they completely
vanish from the heart. When I was able to stop loving and hating under
any circumstance, I was able to transcend suffering. Then it doesn’t
matter what happens; the heart and mind are released and at ease.
Nothing remains. It has all stopped.

Practise like this. If people want to talk a lot about theory that’s their
business. But no matter how much it’s debated, the practice always
comes down to this single point right here. When something arises, it
arises right here. Whether a lot or a little, it originates right here. When it
ceases, the cessation is right here. Where else? The Buddha called this
point the ‘Knowing’. When it knows the way things are accurately, in
line with the truth, we’ll understand the meaning of mind.

Things incessantly deceive. As you study them, they’re simultaneously
deceiving you. How else can I put it? Even though you know about
them, you are still being deluded by them precisely where you know
them. That’s the situation. The issue is this: it’s my opinion that the
Buddha didn’t intend that we only know what these things are called.
The aim of the Buddha’s teachings is to figure out the way to liberate
ourselves from these things through searching for the underlying causes.

## Sīla, Samādhi, and Paññā

I practised Dhamma without knowing a great deal. I just knew that the
path to liberation began with virtue (sīla). Virtue is the beautiful
beginning of the Path. The deep peace of samādhi is the beautiful middle.
Wisdom (paññā) is the beautiful end. Although they can be separated as
three unique aspects of the training, as we look into them more and more
deeply, these three qualities converge as one. To uphold virtue, you have
to be wise. We usually advise people to develop ethical standards first by
keeping the Five Precepts so that their virtue will become solid.
However, the perfection of virtue takes a lot of wisdom. We have to
consider our speech and actions, and analyse their consequences. This is
all the work of wisdom. We have to rely on our wisdom in order to
cultivate virtue.

According to the theory, virtue comes first, then samādhi and then
wisdom, but when I examined it I found that wisdom is the foundation
stone for every other aspect of the practice. In order to fully comprehend
the consequences of what we say and do - especially the harmful
consequences - we need to use wisdom to guide and supervise, to
scrutinize the workings of cause and effect. This will purify our actions
and speech. Once we become familiar with ethical and unethical
behaviour, we see the place to practise. We then abandon what’s bad and
cultivate what’s good. We abandon what’s wrong and cultivate what’s
right. This is virtue. As we do this, the heart becomes increasingly firm
and steadfast. A steadfast and unwavering heart is free of apprehension,
remorse, and confusion concerning our actions and speech. This is
samādhi.

This stable unification of mind forms a secondary and more powerful
source of energy in our Dhamma practice, allowing a deeper
contemplation of the sights, sounds, etc., that we experience. Once the
mind is established with firm and unwavering mindfulness and peace,
we can engage in sustained inquiry into the reality of the body, feeling,
perception, thought, consciousness, sights, sounds, smells, tastes, bodily
sensations and objects of mind. As they continually arise, we continually
investigate with a sincere determination not to lose our mindfulness.
Then we’ll know what these things actually are. They come into existence
following their own natural truth. As our understanding steadily grows,
wisdom is born. Once there’s clear comprehension of the way things
truly are, our old perceptions are uprooted and our conceptual
knowledge transforms into wisdom. That’s how virtue, samādhi and
wisdom merge and function as one.

As wisdom increases in strength and intrepidity, samādhi evolves to
become increasingly firm. The more unshakeable samādhi is, the more
unshakeable and all-encompassing virtue becomes. As virtue is
perfected, it nurtures samādhi, and the additional strengthening of
samādhi leads to a maturing of wisdom. These three aspects of the
training mesh and intertwine. United, they form the Noble Eightfold
Path, the way of the Buddha. Once virtue, samādhi, and wisdom reach
their peak, this Path has the power to eradicate those things which defile
(kilesā) the mind’s purity. When sensual desire comes up, when anger
and delusion show their face, this Path is the only thing capable of
cutting them down in their tracks.

The framework for Dhamma practice is the Four Noble Truths: suffering
(dukkha), the origin of suffering (samudaya), the cessation of suffering
(nirodha) and the Path leading to the cessation of suffering (magga). This
Path consists of virtue, samādhi and wisdom, the framework for training
the heart. Their true meaning is not to be found in these words but
dwells in the depth of our hearts. That’s what virtue, samādhi and
wisdom are like. They revolve continually. The Noble Eightfold Path will
envelop any sight, sound, smell, taste, bodily sensation, or object of mind
that arises. However, if the factors of the Eightfold Path are weak and
timid, the defilements will possess our minds. If the Noble Path is strong
and courageous, it will conquer and destroy the defilements. If the
defilements are powerful and brave while the Path is feeble and frail, the
defilements will conquer the Path. They conquer our hearts. If the
knowing isn’t quick and nimble enough as forms, feelings, perceptions,
and thoughts are experienced, they possess and devastate us. The Path
and the defilements proceed in tandem. As Dhamma practice develops in
the heart, these two forces have to battle it out every step of the way. It’s
as though there are two people arguing inside the mind, but it’s just the
Path of Dhamma and the defilements struggling to win domination of
the heart. The Path guides and fosters our ability to contemplate. As long
as we are able to contemplate accurately, the defilements will be losing
ground. But if we are shaky, whenever defilements regroup and regain
their strength, the Path will be routed as defilements take its place. The
two sides will continue to fight it out until eventually there is a victor
and the whole affair is settled.

If we focus our endeavour on developing the way of Dhamma,
defilements will be gradually and persistently eradicated. Once fully
cultivated, the Four Noble Truths reside in our hearts. Whatever form
suffering takes, it always exists due to a cause. That’s the Second Noble
Truth. And what is the cause? Weak virtue. Weak samādhi. Weak
wisdom. When the Path isn’t durable, the defilements dominate the
mind. When they dominate, the Second Noble Truth comes into play,
and it gives rise to all sorts of suffering. Once we are suffering, those
qualities which are able to quell the suffering disappear. The conditions
which give rise to the Path are virtue, samādhi, and wisdom. When they
have attained full strength, the Path of Dhamma is unstoppable,
advancing unceasingly to overcome the attachment and clinging that
bring us so much anguish. Suffering can’t arise because the Path is
destroying the defilements. It’s at this point that cessation of suffering
occurs. Why is the Path able to bring about the cessation of suffering?
Because virtue, samādhi, and wisdom are attaining their peak of
perfection, and the Path has gathered an unstoppable momentum. It all
comes together right here. I would say for anyone who practises like this,
theoretical ideas about the mind don’t come into the picture. If the mind
is liberated from these, then it is utterly dependable and certain. Now
whatever path it takes, we don’t have to goad it much to keep it going
straight.

Consider the leaves of a mango tree. What are they like? By examining
just a single leaf we know. Even if there are ten thousand of them we
know what all those leaves are like. Just look at one leaf. The others are
essentially the same. Similarly with the trunk. We only have to see the
trunk of one mango tree to know the characteristics of them all. Just look
at one tree. All the other mango trees will be essentially no different.
Even if there were one hundred thousand of them, if I knew one I’d
know them all. This is what the Buddha taught.

Virtue, samādhi, and wisdom constitute the Path of the Buddha. But the
way is not the essence of the Dhamma. The Path isn’t an end in itself, not
the ultimate aim of the Blessed One. But it’s the way leading inwards. It’s
just like how you travelled from Bangkok to my monastery, Wat Nong
Pah Pong. It’s not the road you were after. What you wanted was to
reach the monastery, but you needed the road for the journey. The road
you travelled on is not the monastery. It’s just the way to get here. But if
you want to arrive at the monastery, you have to follow the road. It’s the
same with virtue, samādhi, and wisdom. We could say they are not the
essence of the Dhamma, but they are the road to arrive there. When
virtue, samādhi, and wisdom have been mastered, the result is profound
peace of mind. That’s the destination. Once we’ve arrived at this peace,
even if we hear a noise, the mind remains unruffled. Once we’ve reached
this peace, there’s nothing remaining to do. The Buddha taught to give it
all up. Whatever happens, there’s nothing to worry about. Then we truly,
unquestionably, know for ourselves. We no longer simply believe what
other people say.

The essential principle of Buddhism is empty of any phenomena. It’s not
contingent upon miraculous displays of psychic powers, paranormal
abilities, or anything else mystical or bizarre. The Buddha did not
emphasize the importance of these things. Such powers, however, do
exist and may be possible to develop, but this facet of Dhamma is
deluding, so the Buddha did not advocate or encourage it. The only
people he praised were the ones who were able to liberate themselves
from suffering.

To accomplish this requires training, and the tools and equipment to get
the job done are generosity, virtue, samādhi, and wisdom. We have to
take them up and train with them. Together they form a Path inclining
inwards, and wisdom is the first step. This Path can not mature if the
mind is encrusted with defilements, but if we are stout-hearted and
strong, the Path will eliminate these impurities. However, if it’s the
defilements that are stout-hearted and strong they will destroy the Path.
Dhamma practice simply involves these two forces battling it out
incessantly until the end of the road is reached. They engage in
unremitting battle until the very end.

## The Dangers of Attachment

Using the tools of practice entails hardship and arduous challenges. We
rely on patience, endurance and going without. We have to do it
ourselves, experience it for ourselves, realize it ourselves. Scholars,
however, tend to get confused a lot. For example, when they sit in
meditation, as soon as their minds experience a teeny bit of tranquillity
they start to think, ‘Hey, this must be first jhāna.’ This is how their minds
work. And once those thoughts arise the tranquillity they’d experienced
is shattered. Soon they start to think that it must have been the second
jhāna they’d attained. Don’t think and speculate about it. There aren’t any
billboards which announce which level of samādhi we’re experiencing.
The reality is completely different. There aren’t any signs like the road
signs that tell you, ‘This way to Wat Nong Pah Pong.’ That’s not how I
read the mind. It doesn’t announce.

Although a number of highly esteemed scholars have written
descriptions of the first, second, third, and fourth jhāna, what’s written is
merely external information. If the mind actually enters these states of
profound peace, it doesn’t know anything about those written
descriptions. It knows, but what it knows isn’t the same as the theory we
study. If the scholars try to clutch their theory and drag it into their
meditation, sitting and pondering, ‘Hmm ... what could this be? Is this
first jhāna yet?’ There! The peace is shattered, and they don’t experience
anything of real value. And why is that? Because there is desire, and once
there’s craving what happens? The mind simultaneously withdraws out
of the meditation. So it’s necessary for all of us to relinquish thinking and
speculation. Abandon them completely. Just take up the body, speech
and mind and delve entirely into the practice. Observe the workings of
the mind, but don’t lug the Dhamma books in there with you. Otherwise
everything becomes a big mess, because nothing in those books
corresponds precisely to the reality of the way things truly are.

People who study a lot, who are full of theoretical knowledge, usually
don’t succeed in Dhamma practice. They get bogged down at the
information level. The truth is, the heart and mind can’t be measured by
external standards. If the mind is getting peaceful, just allow it to be
peaceful. The most profound levels of deep peace do exist. Personally, I
didn’t know much about the theory of practice. I’d been a monk for three
years and still had a lot of questions about what samādhi actually was. I
kept trying to think about it and figure it out as I meditated, but my mind
became even more restless and distracted than it had been before! The
amount of thinking actually increased. When I wasn’t meditating it was
more peaceful. Boy, was it difficult, so exasperating! But even though I
encountered so many obstacles, I never threw in the towel. I just kept on
doing it. When I wasn’t trying to do anything in particular, my mind was
relatively at ease. But whenever I determined to make the mind unify in
samādhi, it went out of control. ‘What’s going on here,’ I wondered.
‘Why is this happening?’

Later on I began to realize that meditation was comparable to the process
of breathing. If we’re determined to force the breath to be shallow, deep
or just right, it’s very difficult to do. However, if we go for a stroll and
we’re not even aware of when we’re breathing in or out, it’s extremely
relaxing. So I reflected, ‘Aha! Maybe that’s the way it works.’ When a
person is normally walking around in the course of the day, not focusing
attention on their breath, does their breathing cause them suffering? No,
they just feel relaxed. But when I’d sit down and vow with determination
that I was going to make my mind peaceful, clinging and attachment set
in. When I tried to control the breath to be shallow or deep, it just
brought on more stress than I had before. Why? Because the willpower I
was using was tainted with clinging and attachment. I didn’t know what
was going on. All that frustration and hardship was coming up because I
was bringing craving into the meditation.

## Unshakeable Peace

I once stayed in a forest monastery that was half a mile from a village.
One night the villagers were celebrating with a loud party as I was doing
walking meditation. It must have been after 11:00 and I was feeling a bit
peculiar. I’d been feeling strange like this since midday. My mind was
quiet. There were hardly any thoughts. I felt very relaxed and at ease. I
did walking meditation until I was tired and then went to sit in my grassroofed
hut. As I sat down I barely had time to cross my legs before,
amazingly, my mind just wanted to delve into a profound state of peace.
It happened all by itself. As soon as I sat down, the mind became truly
peaceful. It was rock solid. It wasn’t as if I couldn’t hear the noise of the
villagers singing and dancing - I still could - but I could also shut the
sound out entirely.

Strange. When I didn’t pay attention to the sound, it was perfectly quiet -
I didn’t hear a thing. But if I wanted to hear, I could, without it being a
disturbance. It was like there were two objects in my mind that were
placed side by side but not touching. I could see that the mind and it’s
object of awareness were separate and distinct, just like this spittoon and
water kettle here. Then I understood: when the mind unifies in samādhi,
if you direct your attention outward you can hear, but if you let it dwell
in its emptiness then it’s perfectly silent. When sound was perceived, I
could see that the knowing and the sound were distinctly different. I
contemplated: ‘If this isn’t the way it is, how else could it be?’ That’s the
way it was. These two things were totally separate. I continued
investigating like this until my understanding deepened even further:
‘Ah, this is important. When the perceived continuity of phenomena is
cut, the result is peace.’ The previous illusion of continuity (santati)
transformed into peace of mind (santi). So I continued to sit, putting
effort into the meditation. The mind at that time was focused solely on
the meditation, indifferent to everything else. Had I stopped meditating
at this point it would have been merely because it was complete. I could
have taken it easy, but it wouldn’t have been because of laziness,
tiredness, or feeling annoyed. Not at all. These were absent from the
heart. There was only perfect inner balance and equipoise - just right.

Eventually I did take a break, but it was only the posture of sitting that
changed. My heart remained constant, unwavering and unflagging. I
pulled a pillow over, intending to take a rest. As I reclined, the mind
remained just as peaceful as it had been before. Then, just before my
head hit the pillow, the mind’s awareness began flowing inwards, I
didn’t know where it was headed, but it kept flowing deeper and deeper
within. It was like a current of electricity flowing down a cable to a
switch. When it hit the switch my body exploded with a deafening bang.
The knowing during that time was extremely lucid and subtle. Once past
that point the mind was released to penetrate deeply inside. It went
inside to the point where there wasn’t anything at all. Absolutely nothing
from the outside world could come into that place. Nothing at all could
reach it. Having dwelt internally for some time, the mind then retreated
to flow back out. However, when I say it retreated, I don’t mean to imply
that I made it flow back out. I was simply an observer, only knowing and
witnessing. The mind came out more and more until it finally returned to
normal.

Once my normal state of consciousness returned, the question arose,
‘What was that?!’ The answer came immediately, ‘These things happen
of their own accord. You don’t have to search for an explanation.’ This
answer was enough to satisfy my mind.

After a short time my mind again began flowing inwards. I wasn’t
making any conscious effort to direct the mind. It took off by itself. As it
moved deeper and deeper inside, it again hit that same switch. This time
my body shattered into the most minute particles and fragments. Again
the mind was released to penetrate deeply inside itself. Utter silence. It
was even more profound than the first time. Absolutely nothing external
could reach it. The mind abided here for some time, for as long as it
wished, and then retreated to flow outwards. At that time it was
following its own momentum and happening all by itself. I wasn’t
influencing or directing my mind to be in any particular way, to flow
inwards or retreat outwards. I was merely the one knowing and
watching.

My mind again returned to its normal state of consciousness, and I didn’t
wonder or speculate about what was happening. As I meditated, the
mind once again inclined inwards. This time the entire cosmos shattered
and disintegrated into minute particles. The earth, ground, mountains,
fields and forests - the whole world - disintegrated into the space
element. People had vanished. Everything had disappeared. On this
third time absolutely nothing remained.

The mind, having inclined inwards, settled down there for as long as it
wished. I can’t say I understand exactly how it remained there. It’s
difficult to describe what happened. There’s nothing I can compare it to.
No simile is apt. This time the mind remained inside far longer than it
had previously, and only after some time did it come out of that state.
When I say it came out, I don’t mean to imply that I made it come out or
that I was controlling what was happening. The mind did it all by itself. I
was merely an observer. Eventually it again returned to its normal state
of consciousness. How could you put a name on what happened during
these three times? Who knows? What term are you going to use to label
it?

## The Power of Samādhi

Everything I’ve been relating to you concerns the mind following the
way of nature. This was no theoretical description of the mind or of
psychological states. There’s no need for that. When there’s faith or
confidence, you get in there and really do it. Not just playing around,
you put your life on the line. And when your practice reaches the stage
that I’ve been describing, afterwards the whole world is turned upside
down. Your understanding of reality is completely different. Your view
is utterly transformed. If someone saw you at that moment, they might
think you were insane. If this experience happened to someone who
didn’t have a thorough grip on themselves, they might actually go crazy,
because nothing is the same as it was before. The people of the world
appear differently from how they used to. But you’re the only one who
sees this. Absolutely everything changes. Your thoughts are transmuted:
other people now think in one way, while you think in another. They
speak about things in one way, while you speak in another. They’re
descending one path while you’re climbing another. You’re no longer the
same as other human beings. This way of experiencing things doesn’t
deteriorate. It persists and carries on. Give it a try. If it really is as I
describe, you won’t have to go searching very far. Just look into your
own heart. This heart is staunchly courageous, unshakably bold. This is
the heart’s power, its source of strength and energy. The heart has this
potential strength. This is the power and force of samādhi.

At this point it’s still just the power and purity that the mind derives
from samādhi. This level of samādhi is samādhi at its ultimate. The mind
has attained the summit of samādhi; it’s not mere momentary
concentration. If you were to switch to vipassanā meditation at this point,
the contemplation would be uninterrupted and insightful. Or you could
take that focused energy and use it in other ways. From this point on you
could develop psychic powers, perform miraculous feats or use it
anyway you wanted.

Ascetics and hermits have used samādhi energy for making holy water,
talismans or casting spells. These things are all possible at this stage, and
may be of some benefit in their own way; but it’s like the benefit of
alcohol. You drink it and then you get drunk.

This level of samādhi is a rest stop. The Buddha stopped and rested here.
It forms the foundation for contemplation and vipassanā. However, it’s
not necessary to have such profound samādhi as this in order to observe
the conditions around us, so keep on steadily contemplating the process
of cause and effect. To do this we focus the peace and clarity of our
minds to analyse the sights, sounds, smells, tastes, physical sensations,
thoughts, and mental states we experience. Examine moods and
emotions, whether positive or negative, happy or unhappy. Examine
everything. It’s as though someone else has climbed up a mango tree and
is shaking down the fruit while we wait underneath to gather them up.
The ones which are rotten, we don’t pick up. Just gather the good
mangoes. It’s not exhausting, because we don’t have to climb up the tree.
We simply wait underneath to reap the fruit.

Do you get the meaning of this simile? Everything experienced with a
peaceful mind confers greater understanding. No longer do we create
proliferating interpretations around what is experienced. Wealth, fame,
blame, praise, happiness, and unhappiness come of their own accord.
And we’re at peace. We’re wise. It’s actually fun. It becomes fun to sift
through and sort out these things. What other people call good, bad, evil,
here, there, happiness, unhappiness, or whatever - it all gets taken in for
our own profit. Someone else has climbed up the mango tree and is
shaking the branches to make the mangoes fall down to us. We simply
enjoy ourselves gathering the fruit without fear. What’s there to be afraid
of anyway? It’s someone else who’s shaking the mangoes down to us.
Wealth, fame, praise, criticism, happiness, unhappiness, and all the rest
are no more than mangoes falling down, and we examine them with a
serene heart. Then we’ll know which ones are good and which are rotten.

## Working in Accord with Nature

When we begin to wield the peace and serenity we’ve been developing in
meditation to contemplate these things, wisdom arises. This is what I call
wisdom. This is vipassanā. It’s not something fabricated and construed.
If we’re wise, vipassanā will develop naturally. We don’t have to label
what’s happening. If there’s only a little clarity of insight, we call this
‘little vipassanā’. When clear seeing increases a bit, we call that
‘moderate vipassanā’. If knowing is fully in accordance with the Truth,
we call that ‘ultimate vipassanā’. Personally I prefer to use the word
paññā (wisdom) rather than ‘vipassanā’. If we think we are going to sit
down from time to time and practise ‘vipassanā meditation’, we’re going
to have a very difficult time of it. Insight has to proceed from peace and
tranquillity. The entire process will happen naturally of its own accord.
We can’t force it.

The Buddha taught that this process matures at its own rate. Having
reached this level of practice, we allow it to develop according to our
innate capabilities, spiritual aptitude and the merit we’ve accumulated in
the past. But we never stop putting effort into the practice. Whether the
progress is swift or slow is out of our control. It’s just like planting a tree.
The tree knows how fast it should grow. If we want it to grow more
quickly than it is, this is pure delusion. If we want it to grow more
slowly, recognize this as delusion as well. If we do the work, the results
will be forthcoming - just like planting a tree. For example, say we
wanted to plant a chilli bush. Our responsibility is to dig a hole, plant the
seedling, water it, fertilize it and protect it from insects. This is our job,
our end of the bargain. This is where faith then comes in. Whether the
chilli plant grows or not is up to it. It’s not our business. We can’t go
tugging on the plant, trying to stretch it and make it grow faster. That’s
not how nature works. Our responsibility is to water and fertilize it.
Practising Dhamma in the same way puts our hearts at ease.

If we realize enlightenment in this lifetime, that’s fine. If we have to wait
until our next life, no matter. We have faith and unfaltering conviction in
the Dhamma. Whether we progress quickly or slowly is up to our innate
capabilities, spiritual aptitude, and the merit we’ve accumulated so far.
Practising like this puts the heart at ease. It’s like we’re riding in a horse
cart. We don’t put the cart before the horse. Or it’s like trying to plough a
rice paddy while walking in front of our water buffalo rather than
behind. What I’m saying here is that the mind is getting ahead of itself.
It’s impatient to get quick results. That’s not the way to do it. Don’t walk
in front of your water buffalo. You have to walk behind the water buffalo.

It’s just like that chilli plant we are nurturing. Give it water and fertilizer,
and it will do the job of absorbing the nutrients. When ants or termites
come to infest it, we chase them away. Doing just this much is enough for
the chilli to grow beautifully on its own, and once it is growing
beautifully, we don’t try to force it to flower when we think it should
flower. It’s none of our business. It will just create useless suffering.
Allow it to bloom on its own. And once the flowers do bloom, don’t
demand that it immediately produce chilli peppers. Don’t rely on
coercion. That really causes suffering! Once we figure this out, we
understand what our responsibilities are and what they are not. Each has
their specific duty to fulfil. The mind knows its role in the work to be
done. If the mind doesn’t understand its role, it will try to force the chilli
plant to produce peppers on the very day we plant it. The mind will
insist that it grow, flower, and produce peppers all in one day.

This is nothing but the second Noble Truth: craving causes suffering to
arise. If we are aware of this Truth and ponder it, we’ll understand that
trying to force results in our Dhamma practice is pure delusion. It’s
wrong. Understanding how it works, we let go and allow things to
mature according to our innate capabilities, spiritual aptitude and the
merit we’ve accumulated. We keep doing our part. Don’t worry that it
might take a long time. Even if it takes a hundred or a thousand lifetimes
to get enlightened, so what? However many lifetimes it takes we just
keep practising with a heart at ease, comfortable with our pace. Once our
mind has entered the stream, there’s nothing to fear. It will have gone
beyond even the smallest evil action. The Buddha said that the mind of a
sotāpanna, someone who has attained the first stage of enlightenment, has
entered the stream of Dhamma that flows to enlightenment. These
people will never again have to experience the grim lower realms of
existence, never again fall into hell. How could they possibly fall into hell
when their minds have abandoned evil? They’ve seen the danger in
making bad kamma. Even if you tried to force them to do or say
something evil, they would be incapable of it, so there’s no chance of
ever again descending into hell or the lower realms of existence. Their
minds are flowing with the current of Dhamma.

Once you’re in the stream, you know what your responsibilities are. You
comprehend the work ahead. You understand how to practise Dhamma.
You know when to strive hard and when to relax. You comprehend your
body and mind, this physical and mental process, and you renounce the
things that should be renounced, continually abandoning without a
shred of doubt.

## Changing our Vision

In my life of practising Dhamma, I didn’t attempt to master a wide range
of subjects. Just one. I refined this heart. Say we look at a body. If we find
that we’re attracted to a body then analyse it. Have a good look: head
hair, body hair, nails, teeth and skin.1 The Buddha taught us to
thoroughly and repeatedly contemplate these parts of the body.
Visualize them separately, pull them apart, peel off the skin and burn
them up. This is how to do it. Stick with this meditation until it’s firmly
established and unwavering. See everyone the same. For example, when
the monks and novices go into the village on almsround in the morning,
whoever they see - whether it’s another monk or a villager - they imagine
him or her as a dead body, a walking corpse staggering along on the road
ahead of them. Remain focused on this perception. This is how to put
forth effort. It leads to maturity and development. When you see a young
woman whom you find attractive, imagine her as a walking corpse, her
body putrid and reeking from decomposition. See everyone like that.
And don’t let them get too close! Don’t allow the infatuation to persist in
your heart. If you perceive others as putrid and reeking, I can assure you
the infatuation won’t persist. Contemplate until you’re sure about what
you’re seeing, until it’s definite, until you’re proficient. Whatever path
you then wander down you won’t go astray. Put your whole heart into it.
Whenever you see someone it’s no different from looking at a corpse.
Whether male or female, look at that person as a dead body. And don’t
forget to see yourself as a dead body. Eventually this is all that’s left. Try
to develop this way of seeing as thoroughly as you can. Train with it
until it increasingly becomes part and parcel of your mind. I promise it’s
great fun - if you actually do it. But if you are preoccupied with reading
about it in books, you’ll have a difficult time of it. You’ve got to do it.
And do it with utmost sincerity. Do it until this meditation becomes a
part of you. Make realization of truth your aim. If you’re motivated by
the desire to transcend suffering, then you’ll be on the right path.

These days there are many people teaching vipassanā and a wide range
of meditation techniques. I’ll say this: doing vipassanā is not easy. We
can’t just jump straight into it. It won’t work if it’s not proceeding from a
high standard of morality. Find out for yourself. Moral discipline and
training precepts are necessary, because if our behaviour, actions and
speech aren’t impeccable, we’ll never be able to stand on our own two
feet. Meditation without virtue is like trying to skip over an essential
section of the Path. Similarly, occasionally you hear people say, ‘You
don’t need to develop tranquillity. Skip over it and go straight into the
insight meditation of vipassanā.’ Sloppy people who like to cut corners
say things like this. They say you don’t have to bother with moral
discipline. Upholding and refining your virtue is challenging, not just
playing around. If we could skip over all the teachings on ethical
behaviour, we’d have it pretty easy, wouldn’t we? Whenever we’d
encounter a difficulty, we just avoid it by skipping over it. Of course,
we’d all like to skip over the difficult bits.

There was once a monk I met who told me he was a real meditator. He
asked for permission to stay with me here and enquired about the
schedule and standard of monastic discipline. I explained to him that in
this monastery we live according to the Vinaya, the Buddha’s code of
monastic discipline, and if he wanted to come and train with me he’d
have to renounce his money and private supplies of goods. He told me
his practice was ‘non-attachment to all conventions’. I told him I didn’t
know what he was talking about. ‘How about if I stay here,’ he asked,
‘and keep all my money but don’t attach to it. Money’s just a convention.’
I said sure, no problem. ‘If you can eat salt and not find it salty, then you
can use money and not be attached it.’ He was just speaking gibberish.
Actually he was just too lazy to follow the details of the Vinaya. I’m
telling you, it’s difficult. ‘When you can eat salt and honestly assure me
it’s not salty, then I’ll take you seriously. And if you tell me it’s not salty
then I’ll give you a whole sack to eat. Just try it. Will it really not taste
salty? Non-attachment to conventions isn’t just a matter of clever speech.
If you’re going to talk like this, you can’t stay with me.’ So he left.

We have to try and maintain the practice of virtue. Monastics should
train by experimenting with the ascetic practices (dhutanga), while
laypeople practising at home should keep the Five Precepts. Attempt to
attain impeccability in everything said and done. We should cultivate
goodness to the best of our ability, and keep on gradually doing it.

When starting to cultivate the serenity of samatha meditation, don’t
make the mistake of trying once or twice and then giving up because the
mind is not peaceful. That’s not the right way. You have to cultivate
meditation over a long period of time. Why does it have to take so long?
Think about it. How many years have we allowed our minds to wander
astray? How many years have we not been doing samatha meditation?
Whenever the mind has ordered us to follow it down a particular path,
we’ve rushed after it. To calm that wandering mind, to bring it to a stop,
to make it still, a couple of months of meditation won’t be enough.
Consider this.

When we undertake to train the mind to be at peace with every situation,
please understand that in the beginning when a defiled emotion comes
up, the mind won’t be peaceful. It’s going to be distracted and out of
control. Why? Because there’s craving. We don’t want our mind to think.
We don’t want to experience any distracting moods or emotions. Not
wanting is craving, the craving for non-existence. The more we crave not
to experience certain things, the more we invite and usher them in. ‘I
don’t want these things, so why do they keep coming to me? I wish it
wasn’t this way, so why is it this way?’ There we go! We crave for things
to exist in a particular way, because we don’t understand our own mind.
It can take an incredibly long time before we realize that playing around
with these things is a mistake. Finally, when we consider it clearly we
see, ‘Oh, these things come because I call them.’

Craving not to experience something, craving to be at peace, craving not
to be distracted and agitated - it’s all craving. It’s all a red-hot chunk of
iron. But never mind. Just get on with the practice. Whenever we
experience a mood or emotion, examine it in terms of its impermanence,
unsatisfactoriness, and selfless qualities, and toss it into one of these
three categories. Then reflect and investigate: these defiled emotions are
almost always accompanied by excessive thinking. Wherever a mood
leads, thinking straggles along behind. Thinking and wisdom are two
very different things. Thinking merely reacts to and follows our moods,
and thoughts carry on with no end in sight. But if wisdom is operating, it
will bring the mind to stillness. The mind stops and doesn’t go
anywhere. There’s simply knowing and acknowledging what’s being
experienced. When this emotion comes, the mind’s like this; when that
mood comes, it’s like that. We sustain the ‘knowing’. Eventually it occurs
to us, ‘Hey, all this thinking, this aimless mental chatter, this worrying
and judging - it’s all insubstantial nonsense. It’s all impermanent,
unsatisfactory and not me or mine.’ Toss it into one of these three allencompassing
categories, and quell the uprising. You cut it off at its
source. Later when we again sit meditation, it will come up again. Keep a
close watch on it. Spy on it.

It’s just like raising water buffaloes. You’ve got the farmer, some rice
plants, and the water buffalo. Now the water buffalo wants to eat those
rice plants. Rice plants are what water buffaloes like to eat, right? Your
mind is a water buffalo. Defiled emotions are like the rice plants. The
knowing is the farmer. Dhamma practice is just like this. No different.
Compare it for yourself. When tending a water buffalo, what do you do?
You release it, allowing it to wander freely, but you keep a close eye on
it. If it strays too close to the rice plants, you yell out. When the buffalo
hears, it backs away. Don’t be inattentive, oblivious to what the buffalo is
doing. If you’ve got a stubborn water buffalo that won’t heed your
warning, take a stick and give it a stout whack on the backside. Then it
won’t dare go near the rice plants. Don’t get caught taking a siesta. If you
lie down and doze off, those rice plants will be history. Dhamma practice
is the same: you watch over your mind; the knowing tends the mind.

‘Those people who keep a close watch over their minds will be liberated
from Māra’s snare.’ And yet this knowing mind is also the mind, so
who’s the one observing the mind? Such ideas can make you extremely
confused. The mind is one thing, the knowing another; and yet the
knowing originates in this very same mind. What does it mean to know
the mind? What’s it like to encounter moods and emotions? What’s it like
to be without any defiled emotions whatsoever? That which knows what
these things are is what is meant by the ‘knowing’. The knowing
observantly follows the mind, and it’s from this knowing that wisdom is
born. The mind is that which thinks and gets entangled in emotions, one
after another - precisely like our water buffalo. Whatever directions it
strays in, maintain a watchful eye. How could it get away? If it starts to
drift over towards the rice plants, yell out. If it won’t listen, pick up a
stick and stride over to it. ‘Whack!’ This is how you frustrate craving.

Training the mind is no different. When the mind experiences an
emotion and instantly grabs it, it’s the job of the knowing to teach.
Examine the mood to see if it’s good or bad. Explain to the mind how
cause and effect functions. And when it again grabs onto something that
it thinks is adorable, the knowing has to again teach the mind, again
explain cause and effect, until the mind is able to cast that thing aside.
This leads to peace of mind. After finding out that whatever it grabs and
grasps is inherently undesirable, the mind simply stops. It can’t be
bothered with those things anymore, because it’s come under a constant
barrage of rebukes and reprimands. Thwart the craving of the mind with
determination. Challenge it to its core, until the teachings penetrate to the
heart. That’s how you train the mind.

Since the time when I withdrew to the forest to practise meditation, I’ve
been practising like this. When I train my disciples, I train them to
practise like this, because I want them to see the truth, rather than just
read what’s in the scriptures; I want them to see if their hearts have been
liberated from conceptual thinking. When liberation occurs, you know;
and when liberation has not yet happened, then contemplate the process
of how one thing causes and leads to another. Contemplate until you
know and understand it through and through. Once it’s been penetrated
with insight, it will fall away on its own. When something comes your
way and gets stuck, investigate it. Don’t give up until it has released its
grip. Repeatedly investigate right here. Personally, this is how I
approached the training, because the Buddha taught that you have to
know for yourself. All sages know the truth for themselves. You’ve got to
discover it in the depths of your own heart. Know yourself.

If you are confident in what you know and trust yourself, you will feel
relaxed whether others criticize or praise you. Whatever other people
say, you’re at ease. Why? Because you know yourself. If someone
bolsters you with praise, but you know you’re not actually worthy of it,
are you really going to believe them? Of course not. You just carry on
with your Dhamma practice. When people who aren’t confident in what
they know get praised by others, they get sucked into believing it and it
warps their perception. Likewise when someone criticizes you, take a
look at and examine yourself. ‘No, what they say isn’t true. They accuse
me of being wrong, but actually I’m not. Their accusation isn’t valid.’ If
that’s the case, what would be the point of getting angry with them?
Their words aren’t true. If, however, we are at fault just as they accuse,
then their criticism is correct. If that’s the case, what would be the point
of getting angry with them? When you’re able to think like this, life is
truly untroubled and comfortable. Nothing that then happens is wrong.
Then everything is Dhamma. That is how I practised.

## Following the Middle Path

It’s the shortest and most direct path. You can come and argue with me
on points of Dhamma, but I won’t join in. Rather than argue back, I’d just
offer some reflections for you to consider. Please understand what the
Buddha taught: let go of everything. Let go with knowing and
awareness. Without knowing and awareness, the letting go is no
different than that of cows and water buffaloes. Without putting your
heart into it, the letting go isn’t correct. You let go because you
understand conventional reality. This is non-attachment. The Buddha
taught that in the beginning stages of Dhamma practice you should work
very hard, develop things thoroughly and attach a lot. Attach to the
Buddha. Attach to the Dhamma. Attach to the Sangha. Attach firmly and
deeply. That’s what the Buddha taught. Attach with sincerity and
persistence and hold on tight.

In my own search I tried nearly every possible means of contemplation. I
sacrificed my life for the Dhamma, because I had faith in the reality of
enlightenment and the Path to get there. These things actually do exist,
just like the Buddha said they did. But to realize them takes practice,
right practice. It takes pushing yourself to the limit. It takes the courage
to train, to reflect, and to fundamentally change. It takes the courage to
actually do what it takes. And how do you do it? Train the heart. The
thoughts in our heads tell us to go in one direction, but the Buddha tells
us to go in another. Why is it necessary to train? Because the heart is
totally encrusted with and plastered over with defilements. That’s what a
heart is like that has not yet been transformed through the training. It’s
unreliable, so don’t believe it. It’s not yet virtuous. How can we trust a
heart that lacks purity and clarity? Therefore, the Buddha warned us not
to put our trust in a defiled heart. Initially the heart is only the hired
hand of defilement, but if they associate together for an extended period
of time, the heart is distorted to become defilement itself. That’s why the
Buddha taught us not to trust our hearts.

If we take a good look at our monastic training discipline, we’ll see that
the whole thing is about training the heart. And whenever we train the
heart we feel hot and bothered. As soon as we’re hot and bothered we
start to complain, ‘Boy, this practice is incredibly difficult! It’s
impossible.’ But the Buddha didn’t think like that. He considered that
when the training was causing us heat and friction, that meant we were
on the right track. We don’t think that way. We think it’s a sign that
something is wrong. This misunderstanding is what makes the practice
seem so arduous. In the beginning we feel hot and bothered, so we think
we’re off track. Everyone wants to feel good, but they’re less concerned
about whether it’s right or not. When we go against the grain of the
defilements and challenge our cravings, of course we feel suffering. We
get hot, upset, and bothered and then quit. We think we’re on the wrong
path. The Buddha, however, would say we’re getting it right. We’re
confronting our defilements, and they are what is getting hot and
bothered. But we think it’s us who are hot and bothered. The Buddha
taught that it’s the defilements that get stirred up and upset. It’s the same
for everyone.

That’s why Dhamma practice is so demanding. People don’t examine
things clearly. Generally, they lose the Path on either the side of selfindulgence
or self-torment. They get stuck in these two extremes. On one
hand they like to indulge their heart’s desires. Whatever they feel like
doing they just do it. They like to sit in comfort. They love to lie down
and stretch out in comfort. Whatever they do, they seek to do it in
comfort. This is what I mean by self-indulgence: clinging to feeling good.
With such indulgence how could Dhamma practice possibly progress?

If we can no longer indulge in comfort, sensuality and feeling good, we
become irritated. We get upset and angry and suffer because of it. This is
falling off the Path on the side of self-torment. This is not the path of a
peaceful sage, not the way of someone who’s still. The Buddha warned
not to stray down these two sidetracks of self-indulgence and selftorment.
When experiencing pleasure, just know that with awareness.
When experiencing anger, ill-will, and irritation, understand that you are
not following in the footsteps of the Buddha. Those aren’t the paths of
people seeking peace, but the roads of common villagers. A monk at
peace doesn’t walk down those roads. He strides straight down the
middle with self-indulgence on the left and self-torment on the right.
This is correct Dhamma practice.

If you’re going to take up this monastic training, you have to walk this
Middle Way, not getting worked up about either happiness or
unhappiness. Set them down. But it feels like they’re kicking us around.
First they kick us from one side, ‘Ow!’ , then they kick us from the other,
‘Ow!’ We feel like the clapper in our wooden bell, knocked back and
forth from side to side. The Middle Way is all about letting go of
happiness and unhappiness, and the right practice is the practice in the
middle. When the craving for happiness hits and we don’t satisfy it, we
feel the pain.

Walking down the Middle Path of the Buddha is arduous and
challenging. There are just these two extremes of good and bad. If we
believe what they tell us, we have to follow their orders. If we become
enraged at someone, we immediately go searching for a stick to attack
them. We have no patient endurance. If we love someone we want to
caress them from head to toe. Am I right? These two sidetracks
completely miss the middle. This is not what the Buddha recommended.
His teaching was to gradually put these things down. His practice was a
path leading out of existence, away from rebirth - a path free of
becoming, birth, happiness, unhappiness, good, and evil.

Those people who crave existence are blind to what’s in the middle. They
fall off the Path on the side of happiness and then completely pass over
the middle on their way to the other side of dissatisfaction and irritation.
They continually skip over the centre. This sacred place is invisible to
them as they rush back and forth. They don’t stay in that place where
there is no existence and no birth. They don’t like it, so they don’t stay.
Either they go down out of their home and get bitten by a dog or fly up
to get pecked by a vulture. This is existence.

Humanity is blind to that which is free from existence with no rebirth.
The human heart is blind to it, so it repeatedly passes it by and skips it
over. The Middle Way walked by the Buddha, the Path of correct
Dhamma practice, transcends existence and rebirth. The mind that is
beyond both the wholesome and the unwholesome is released. This is the
path of a peaceful sage. If we don’t walk it we’ll never be a sage at peace.
That peace will never have a chance to bloom. Why? Because of existence
and rebirth. Because there’s birth and death. The path of the Buddha is
without birth or death. There’s no low and no high. There’s no happiness
and no suffering. There’s no good and no evil. This is the straight path.
This is the path of peace and stillness. It’s peacefully free of pleasure and
pain, happiness and sorrow. This is how to practise Dhamma.
Experiencing this, the mind can stop. It can stop asking questions.
There’s no longer any need to search for answers. There! That’s why the
Buddha said that the Dhamma is something that the wise know directly
for themselves. No need to ask anybody. We understand clearly for
ourselves without a shred of doubt that things are exactly as the Buddha
said they were.

## Dedication to the Practice

So I’ve told you a few brief stories about how I practised. I didn’t have a
lot of knowledge. I didn’t study much. What I did study was this heart
and mind of mine, and I learned in a natural way through
experimentation, trial and error. When I liked something, then I
examined what was going on and where it would lead. Inevitably, it
would drag me to some distant suffering. My practice was to observe
myself. As understanding and insight deepened, gradually I came to
know myself.

Practise with unflinching dedication! If you want to practise Dhamma,
then please try not to think too much. If you’re meditating and you find
yourself trying to force specific results, then it’s better to stop. When your
mind settles down to become peaceful and then you think, ‘That’s it!
That’s it, isn’t it? Is this it?,’ then stop. Take all your analytical and
theoretical knowledge, wrap it up and store it away in a chest. And don’t
drag it out for discussion or to teach. That’s not the type of knowledge
that penetrates inside. They are different types of knowledge.

When the reality of something is seen, it’s not the same as the written
descriptions. For example, let’s say we write down the word ‘sensual
desire’. When sensual desire actually overwhelms the heart, it’s
impossible that the written word can convey the same meaning as the
reality. It’s the same with ‘anger’. We can write the letters on a
blackboard, but when we’re actually angry the experience is not the
same. We can’t read those letters fast enough, and the heart is engulfed
by rage.

This is an extremely important point. The theoretical teachings are
accurate, but it’s essential to bring them into our hearts. It must be
internalized. If the Dhamma isn’t brought into the heart, it’s not truly
known. It’s not actually seen. I was no different. I didn’t study
extensively, but I did do enough to pass some of the exams on Buddhist
theory. One day I had the opportunity to listen to a Dhamma talk from a
meditation master. As I listened, some disrespectful thoughts came up. I
didn’t know how to listen to a real Dhamma talk. I couldn’t figure out
what this wandering meditation monk was talking about. He was
teaching as though it was coming from his own direct experience, as if he
was after the truth.

As time went on and I gained some first-hand experience in the practice,
I saw for myself the truth of what that monk taught. I understood how to
understand. Insight then followed in its wake. Dhamma was taking root
in my own heart and mind. It was a long, long time before I realized that
everything that that wandering monk had taught came from what he’d
seen for himself. The Dhamma he taught came directly from his own
experience, not from a book. He spoke according to his understanding
and insight. When I walked the Path myself, I came across every detail
he’d described and had to admit he was right. So I continued on.

Try to take every opportunity you can to put effort into Dhamma
practice. Whether it’s peaceful or not, don’t worry about it at this point.
The highest priority is to set the wheels of practice in motion and create
the causes for future liberation. If you’ve done the work, there’s no need
to worry about the results. Don’t be anxious that you won’t gain results.
Anxiety is not peaceful. If however, you don’t do the work, how can you
expect results? How can you ever hope to see? The one who searches
discovers. The one who eats is full. Everything around us lies to us.
Recognizing this even ten times is still pretty good. But the same old coot
keeps telling us the same old lies and stories. If we know he’s lying, it’s
not so bad, but it can be an exceedingly long time before we know. The
old fellow comes and tries to hoodwink us with deception time and time
again.

Practising Dhamma means upholding virtue, developing samādhi and
cultivating wisdom in our hearts. Remember and reflect on the Triple
Gem: the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. Abandon absolutely
everything without exception. Our own actions are the causes and
conditions that will ripen in this very life. So strive on with sincerity.

Even if we have to sit in a chair to meditate, it’s still possible to focus our
attention. In the beginning we don’t have to focus on many things - just
our breath. If we prefer, we can mentally repeat the words ‘Buddha’,
‘Dhamma’, or ‘Sangha’ in conjunction with each breath. While focusing
attention, resolve not to control the breath. If breathing seems laborious
or uncomfortable, this indicates we’re not approaching it right. As long
as we’re not yet at ease with the breath, it will seem too shallow or too
deep, too subtle or too rough. However, once we relax with our breath,
finding it pleasant and comfortable, clearly aware of each inhalation and
exhalation, then we’re getting the hang of it. If we’re not doing it
properly we will lose the breath. If this happens then it’s better to stop
for a moment and refocus the mindfulness.

If while meditating you get the urge to experience psychic phenomena or
the mind becomes luminous and radiant or you have visions of celestial
palaces, etc., there’s no need to fear. Simply be aware of whatever you’re
experiencing, and continue on meditating. Occasionally, after some time,
the breath may appear to slow to a halt. The sensation of the breath
seems to vanish and you become alarmed. Don’t worry, there’s nothing
to be afraid of. You only think your breathing has stopped. Actually the
breath is still there, but it’s functioning on a much more subtle level than
usual. With time the breath will return to normal by itself.

In the beginning, just concentrate on making the mind calm and peaceful.
Whether sitting in a chair, riding in a car, taking a boat ride, or wherever
you happen to be, you should be proficient enough in your meditation
that you can enter a state of peace at will. When you get on a train and sit
down, quickly bring your mind to a state of peace. Wherever you are,
you can always sit. This level of proficiency indicates that you’re
becoming familiar with the Path. You then investigate. Utilize the power
of this peaceful mind to investigate what you experience.

At times it’s what you see; at times what you hear, smell, taste, feel with
your body, or think and feel in your heart. Whatever sensory experience
presents itself - whether you like it or not - take that up for
contemplation. Simply know what you are experiencing. Don’t project
meaning or interpretations onto those objects of sense awareness. If it’s
good, just know that it’s good. If it’s bad, just know that it’s bad. This is
conventional reality. Good or evil, it’s all impermanent, unsatisfying and
not-self. It’s all undependable. None of it is worthy of being grasped or
clung to.

If you can maintain this practice of peace and inquiry, wisdom will
automatically be generated. Everything sensed and experienced then
falls into these three pits of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and notself.
This is vipassanā meditation. The mind is already peaceful, and
whenever impure states of mind surface, throw them away into one of
these three rubbish pits. This is the essence of vipassanā: discarding
everything into impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and not-self. Good,
bad, horrible, or whatever, toss it down. In a short time, understanding
and insight - feeble insight, that is, will blossom forth in the midst of the
three universal characteristics.

At this beginning stage the wisdom is still weak and feeble, but try to
maintain this practice with consistency. It’s difficult to put into words,
but it’s like if somebody wanted to get to know me, they’d have to come
and live here. Eventually with daily contact we would get to know each
other.

## Respect the Tradition

It’s high time we started to meditate. Meditate to understand, to
abandon, to relinquish, and to be at peace.

I used to be a wandering monk. I’d travel by foot to visit teachers and
seek solitude. I didn’t go around giving Dhamma talks. I went to listen to
the Dhamma talks of the great Buddhist masters of the time. I didn’t go
to teach them. I listened to whatever advice they had to offer. Even when
young or junior monks tried to tell me what the Dhamma was, I listened
patiently. However, I rarely got into discussions about the Dhamma. I
couldn’t see the point in getting involved in lengthy discussions.
Whatever teachings I accepted I took on board straight away, directly
where they pointed to renunciation and letting go. What I did, I did for
renunciation and letting go. We don’t have to become experts in the
scriptures. We’re getting older with every day that passes, and every day
we pounce on a mirage, missing the real thing. Practising the Dhamma is
something quite different from studying it.

I don’t criticize any of the wide variety of meditation styles and
techniques. As long as we understand their true purpose and meaning,
they’re not wrong. However, calling ourselves Buddhist meditators, but
not strictly following the monastic code of discipline (Vinaya) will, in my
opinion, never meet with success. Why? Because we try to bypass a vital
section of the Path. Skipping over virtue, samādhi or wisdom won’t
work. Some people may tell you not to get attached to the serenity of
samatha meditation: ‘Don’t bother with samatha; advance straight to the
wisdom and insight practices of vipassanā.’ As I see it, if we attempt to
detour straight to vipassanā, we’ll find it impossible to successfully
complete the journey.

Don’t forsake the style of practice and meditation techniques of the
eminent forest masters, such as the Venerable Ajahns Sao, Mun,
Taungrut, and Upāli. The path they taught is utterly reliable and true - if
we do it the way they did. If we follow in their footsteps, we’ll gain true
insight into ourselves. Ajahn Sao cared for his virtue impeccably. He
didn’t say we should bypass it. If these great masters of the forest
tradition recommended practising meditation and monastic etiquette in a
particular way, then out of deep respect for them we should follow what
they taught. If they said to do it, then do it. If they said to stop because
it’s wrong, then stop. We do it out of faith. We do it with unwavering
sincerity and determination. We do it until we see the Dhamma in our
own hearts, until we are the Dhamma. This is what the forest masters
taught. Their disciples consequently developed profound respect, awe
and affection for them, because it was through following their path, that
they saw what their teachers saw.

Give it a try. Do it just like I say. If you actually do it, you’ll see the
Dhamma, be the Dhamma. If you actually undertake the search, what
would stop you? The defilements of the mind will be vanquished if you
approach them with the right strategy: be someone who renounces, one
who is frugal with words, who is content with little, and who abandons
all views and opinions stemming from self-importance and conceit. You
will then be able to listen patiently to anyone, even if what they’re saying
is wrong. You will also be able to listen patiently to people when they’re
right. Examine yourself in this way. I assure you, it’s possible, if you try.
Scholars however, rarely come and put the Dhamma into practice. There
are some, but they are few. It’s a shame. The fact that you’ve made it this
far and have come to visit is already worthy of praise. It shows inner
strength. Some monasteries only encourage studying. The monks study
and study, on and on, with no end in sight, and never cut that which
needs to be cut. They only study the word ‘peace’. But if you can stop
still, you’ll discover something of real value. This is how you do research.
This research is truly valuable and completely immobile. It goes straight
to what you’ve been reading about. If scholars don’t practise meditation
however, their knowledge has little understanding. Once they put the
teachings into practice, those things which they have studied about then
become vivid and clear.

So start practising! Develop this type of understanding. Give living in the
forest a try, come and stay in one of these tiny huts. Trying out this
training for a while and testing it for yourself would be of far greater
value than just reading books. Then you can have discussions with
yourself. While observing the mind it’s as if it lets go and rests in its
natural state. When it ripples and wavers from this still, natural state in
the form of thoughts and concepts, the conditioning process of sankhāra is
set in motion. Be very careful and keep a watchful eye on this process of
conditioning. Once it moves and is dislodged from this natural state,
Dhamma practice is no longer on the right track. It steps off into either
self-indulgence or self-torment. Right there. That’s what gives rise to this
web of mental conditioning. If the state of mind is a good one, this
creates positive conditioning. If it’s bad, the conditioning is negative.
These originate in your own mind.

I’m telling you, it’s great fun to observe closely how the mind works. I
could happily talk about this one subject the whole day. When you get to
know the ways of the mind, you’ll see how this process functions and
how it’s kept going through being brainwashed by the mind’s impurities.
I see the mind as merely a single point. Psychological states are guests
who come to visit this spot. Sometimes this person comes to call;
sometimes that person pays a visit. They come to the visitor centre. Train
the mind to watch and know them all with the eyes of alert awareness.
This is how you care for your heart and mind. Whenever a visitor
approaches you wave them away. If you allow them to enter, where are
they going to sit down? There’s only one seat, and you’re sitting in it.
Spend the whole day in this one spot.

This is the Buddha’s firm and unshakeable awareness that watches over
and protects the mind. You’re sitting right here. Since the moment you
emerged from the womb, every visitor that’s ever come to call has
arrived right here. No matter how often they come, they always come to
this same spot, right here. Knowing them all, the Buddha’s awareness
sits alone, firm and unshakeable. Those visitors journey here seeking to
exert influence, to condition and sway your mind in various ways. When
they succeed in getting the mind entangled in their issues, psychological
states arise. Whatever the issue is, wherever it seems to be leading, just
forget it - it doesn’t matter. Simply know who the guests are as they
arrive. Once they’ve dropped by they will find that there’s only one
chair, and as long as you’re occupying it they will have nowhere to sit
down. They come thinking to fill your ear with gossip, but this time
there’s no room for them to sit. Next time they come there will also be no
chair free. No matter how many times these chattering visitors show up,
they always meet the same fellow sitting in the same spot. You haven’t
budged from that chair. How long do you think they will continue to put
up with this situation? In just speaking to them you get to know them
thoroughly. Everyone and everything you’ve ever known since you
began to experience the world will come for a visit. Simply observing
and being aware right here is enough to see the Dhamma entirely. You
discuss, observe and contemplate by yourself.

This is how to discuss Dhamma. I don’t know how to talk about anything
else. I can continue on speaking in this fashion, but in the end it’s nothing
but talking and listening. I’d recommend you actually go and do the
practice.

## Mastering the Meditation

If you have a look for yourself, you’ll encounter certain experiences.
There’s a Path to guide you and offer directions. As you carry on, the
situation changes and you have to adjust your approach to remedy the
problems that come up. It can be a long time before you see a clear
signpost. If you’re going to walk the same Path as I did, the journey
definitely has to take place in your own heart. If not, you’ll encounter
numerous obstacles.

It’s just like hearing a sound. The hearing is one thing, the sound another,
and we are consciously aware of both without compounding the event.
We rely on nature to provide the raw material for the investigation in
search of Truth. Eventually the mind dissects and separates phenomena
on its own. Simply put, the mind doesn’t get involved. When the ears
pick up a sound, observe what happens in the heart and mind. Do they
get bound up, entangled, and carried away by it? Do they get irritated?
At least know this much. When a sound then registers, it won’t disturb
the mind. Being here, we take up those things close at hand rather than
those far away. Even if we’d like to flee from sound, there’s no escape.
The only escape possible is through training the mind to be unwavering
in the face of sound. Set sound down. The sounds we let go of we can
still hear. We hear but we let sound go, because we’ve already set it
down. It’s not that we have to forcefully separate the hearing and the
sound. It separates automatically due to abandoning and letting go. Even
if we then wanted to cling to a sound, the mind wouldn’t cling. Because
once we understand the true nature of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and
all the rest, and the heart sees with clear insight, everything sensed
without exception falls within the domain of the universal characteristics
of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, and not-self.

Whenever we hear a sound it’s understood in terms of these universal
characteristics. Whenever there’s sense contact with the ear, we hear but
it’s as if we didn’t hear. This doesn’t mean the mind no longer functions.
Mindfulness and the mind intertwine and merge to monitor each other at
all times without a lapse. When the mind is trained to this level, no
matter what path we then choose to walk we will be doing research. We
will be cultivating the analysis of phenomena, one of the essential factors
of enlightenment, and this analysis will keep rolling on with its own
momentum.

Discuss Dhamma with yourself. Unravel and release feeling, memory,
perception, thinking, intentions, and consciousness. Nothing will be able
to touch them as they continue to perform their functions on their own.
For people who have mastered their minds, this process of reflection and
investigation flows along automatically. It’s no longer necessary to direct
it intentionally. Whatever sphere the mind inclines towards, the
contemplation is immediately adept.

If Dhamma practice reaches this level, there’s another interesting side
benefit. While asleep, snoring, talking in our sleep, gnashing our teeth,
and tossing and turning will all stop. Even if we’ve been resting in deep
sleep, when we wake up we won’t be drowsy. We’ll feel energized and
alert as if we’d been awake the whole time. I used to snore, but once the
mind remained awake at all times, snoring stopped. How can you snore
when you’re awake? It’s only the body that stops and sleeps. The mind is
wide awake day and night, around the clock. This is the pure and
heightened awareness of the Buddha: the One Who Knows, the
Awakened One, the Joyous One, the Brilliantly Radiant One. This clear
awareness never sleeps. Its energy is self-sustaining, and it never gets
dull or sleepy. At this stage we can go without rest for two or three days.
When the body begins to show signs of exhaustion, we sit down to
meditate and immediately enter deep samādhi for five or ten minutes.
When we come out of that state, we feel fresh and invigorated as if we’ve
had a full night’s sleep. If we’re beyond concern for the body, sleep is of
minimal importance. We take appropriate measures to care for the body,
but we aren’t anxious about its physical condition. Let it follow its
natural laws. We don’t have to tell the body what to do. It tells itself. It’s
as if someone is prodding us, urging us to strive on in our efforts. Even if
we feel lazy, there’s a voice inside that constantly rouses our diligence.
Stagnation at this point is impossible, because effort and progress have
gathered an unstoppable momentum. Please check this out for yourself.
You’ve been studying and learning a long time. Now it’s time to study
and learn about yourself.

In the beginning stages of Dhamma practice, physical seclusion is of vital
importance. When you live alone in isolation you will recall the words of
Venerable Sāriputta: ‘Physical seclusion is a cause and condition for the
arising of mental seclusion, states of profound samādhi free from
external sense contact. This seclusion of the mind is in turn a cause and
condition for seclusion from mental defilements, enlightenment.’ And
yet some people still say that seclusion is not important: ‘If your heart is
peaceful, it doesn’t matter where you are.’ It’s true, but in the beginning
stages we should remember that physical seclusion in a suitable
environment comes first. Today, or sometime soon, seek out a lonely
cremation ground in a remote forest far from any habitation. Experiment
with living all alone. Or seek out a fear-inspiring mountain peak. Go off
and live alone, okay? You’ll have lots of fun all night long. Only then will
you know for yourself. Even I once thought that physical seclusion
wasn’t particularly important. That’s what I thought, but once I actually
got out there and did it, I reflected on what the Buddha taught. The
Blessed One encouraged his disciples to practise in remote locations far
removed from society. In the beginning this builds a foundation for
internal seclusion of the mind which then supports the unshakeable
seclusion from defilements.

For example, say you’re a lay person with a home and a family. What
seclusion do you get? When you return home, as soon as you step inside
the front door you get hit with chaos and complication. There’s no
physical seclusion. So you slip away for a retreat in a remote
environment and the atmosphere is completely different. It’s necessary to
comprehend the importance of physical isolation and solitude in the
initial stages of Dhamma practice. You then seek out a meditation master
for instruction. He or she guides, advises and points out those areas
where your understanding is wrong, because it’s precisely where you
misunderstand that you think you are right. Right where you’re wrong,
you’re sure you’re right. Once the teacher explains, you understand what
is wrong, and right where the teacher says you’re wrong is precisely
where you thought you were right.

From what I’ve heard, there are a number of Buddhist scholar monks
who search and research in accordance with the scriptures. There’s no
reason why we shouldn’t experiment. When it’s time to open our books
and study, we learn in that style. But when it’s time to take up arms and
engage in combat, we have to fight in a style that may not correspond
with the theory. If a warrior enters battle and fights according to what
he’s read, he’ll be no match for his opponent. When the warrior is sincere
and the fight is real, he has to battle in a style that goes beyond theory.
That’s how it is. The Buddha’s words in the scriptures are only
guidelines and examples to follow, and studying can sometimes lead to
carelessness.

The way of the forest masters is the way of renunciation. On this Path
there’s only abandoning. We uproot views stemming from selfimportance.
We uproot the very essence of our sense of self. I assure you,
this practice will challenge you to the core, but no matter how difficult it
is don’t discard the forest masters and their teachings. Without proper
guidance the mind and samādhi are potentially very deluding. Things
which shouldn’t be possible begin to happen. I’ve always approached
such phenomena with caution and care. When I was a young monk, just
starting out in practice during my first few years, I couldn’t yet trust my
mind. However, once I’d gained considerable experience and could fully
trust the workings of my mind, nothing could pose a problem. Even if
unusual phenomena manifested, I’d just leave it at that. If we are clued in
to how these things work, they cease by themselves. It’s all fuel for
wisdom. As time goes on we find ourselves completely at ease.

In meditation, things which usually aren’t wrong can be wrong. For
example, we sit down cross-legged with determination and resolve: ‘All
right! No pussyfooting around this time. I will concentrate the mind. Just
watch me.’ No way that approach will work! Everytime I tried that my
meditation got nowhere. But we love the bravado. From what I’ve
observed, meditation will develop at its own rate. Many evenings as I sat
down to meditate I thought to myself, ‘All right! Tonight I won’t budge
from this spot until at least 1:00 am.’ Even with this thought I was
already making some bad kamma, because it wasn’t long before the pain
in my body attacked from all sides, overwhelming me until it felt as
though I was going to die. However, those occasions when the
meditation went well were times when I didn’t place any limits on the
sitting. I didn’t set a goal of 7:00, 8:00, 9:00 or whatever, but simply kept
sitting, steadily carrying on, letting go with equanimity. Don’t force the
meditation. Don’t attempt to interpret what’s happening. Don’t coerce
your heart with unrealistic demands that it enter a state of samādhi - or
else you’ll find it even more agitated and unpredictable than normal. Just
allow the heart and mind to relax, be comfortable and at ease.

Allow the breathing to flow easily at just the right pace, neither too short
nor too long. Don’t try to make it into anything special. Let the body
relax, comfortable and at ease. Then keep doing it. Your mind will ask
you, ‘How late are we going to meditate tonight? What time are we
going to quit?’ It incessantly nags, so you have to bellow out a
reprimand, ‘Listen buddy, just leave me alone.’ This busybody
questioner needs to be regularly subdued, because it’s nothing other than
defilement coming to annoy you. Don’t pay it any attention whatsoever.
You have to be tough with it. ‘Whether I call it quits early or have a late
night, it’s none of your damn business! If I want to sit all night, it doesn’t
make any difference to anyone, so why do you come and stick your nose
into my meditation?’ You have to cut the nosy fellow off like that. You
can then carry on meditating for as long as you wish, according to what
feels right.

As you allow the mind to relax and be at ease, it becomes peaceful.
Experiencing this, you’ll recognize and appreciate the power of clinging.
When you can sit on and on, for a very long time, going past midnight,
comfortable and relaxed, you’ll know you’re getting the hang of
meditation. You’ll understand how attachment and clinging really do
defile the mind.

When some people sit down to meditate they light a stick of incense in
front of them and vow, ‘I won’t get up until this stick of incense has
burned down.’ Then they sit. After what seems like an hour they open
their eyes and realize only five minutes have gone by. They stare at the
incense, disappointed at how exceedingly long the stick still is. They
close their eyes again and continue. Soon their eyes are open once more
to check that stick of incense. These people don’t get anywhere in
meditation. Don’t do it like that. Just sitting and dreaming about that
stick of incense, ‘I wonder if it’s almost finished burning,’ the meditation
gets nowhere. Don’t give importance to such things. The mind doesn’t
have to do anything special.

If you are going to undertake the task of developing the mind in
meditation, don’t let the defilement of craving know the ground rules or
the goal. ‘How will you meditate, Venerable?,’ it inquires. ‘How much
will you do? How late are you thinking of going?’ Craving keeps
pestering until we submit to an agreement. Once we declare we’re going
to sit until midnight, it immediately begins to hassle us. Before even an
hour has passed we’re feeling so restless and impatient that we can’t
continue. Then more hindrances attack as we berate ourselves, ‘Hopeless!
What, is sitting going to kill you? You said you were going to make your
mind unshakeable in samādhi, but it’s still unreliable and all over the
place. You made a vow and you didn’t keep it.’ Thoughts of selfdepreciation
and dejection assail our minds, and we sink into self-hatred.
There’s no one else to blame or get angry at, and that makes it all the
worse. Once we make a vow we have to keep it. We either fulfil it or die
in the process. If we do vow to sit for a certain length of time, we
shouldn’t break that vow and stop. In the meantime however, just
gradually practise and develop. There’s no need for making dramatic
vows. Try to steadily and persistently train the mind. Occasionally, the
meditation will be peaceful, and all the aches and discomfort in the body
will vanish. The pain in the ankles and knees will cease by itself.

Once we try our hand at cultivating meditation, if strange images,
visions or sensory perceptions start coming up, the first thing to do is to
check our state of mind. Don’t discard this basic principle. For such
images to arise the mind has to be relatively peaceful. Don’t crave for
them to appear, and don’t crave for them not to appear. If they do arise
examine them, but don’t allow them to delude. Just remember they’re
not ours. They are impermanent, unsatisfying and not-self just like
everything else. Even if they are real, don’t dwell on or pay much
attention to them. If they stubbornly refuse to fade, then refocus your
awareness on your breath with increased vigour. Take at least three long,
deep breaths and each time slowly exhale completely. This may do the
trick. Keep re-focusing the attention.

Don’t become possessive of such phenomena. They are nothing more
than what they are, and what they are is potentially deluding. Either we
like them and fall in love with them or the mind becomes poisoned with
fear. They’re unreliable: they may not be true or what they appear to be.
If you experience them, don’t try to interpret their meaning or project
meaning onto them. Remember they’re not ours, so don’t run after these
visions or sensations. Instead, immediately go back and check the present
state of mind. This is our rule of thumb. If we abandon this basic
principle and become drawn into what we believe we are seeing, we can
forget ourselves and start babbling or even go insane. We may lose our
marbles to the point where we can’t even relate to other people on a
normal level. Place your trust in your own heart. Whatever happens,
simply carry on observing the heart and mind. Strange meditative
experiences can be beneficial for people with wisdom, but dangerous for
those without. Whatever occurs don’t become elated or alarmed. If
experiences happen, they happen.

Another way to approach Dhamma practice is to contemplate and
examine everything we see, do, and experience. Never discard the
meditation. When some people finish sitting or walking meditation they
think it’s time to stop and rest. They stop focusing their minds on their
object of meditation or theme of contemplation. They completely drop it.
Don’t practise like that. Whatever you see, inquire into what it really is.
Contemplate the good people in the world. Contemplate the evil ones
too. Take a penetrating look at the rich and powerful; the destitute and
poverty-stricken. When you see a child, an elderly person or a young
man or woman, investigate the meaning of age. Everything is fuel for
inquiry. This is how you cultivate the mind.

The contemplation that leads to the Dhamma is the contemplation of
conditionality, the process of cause and effect, in all its various
manifestations: major and minor, black and white, good and bad. In
short, everything. When you think, recognize it as a thought and
contemplate that it’s merely that, nothing more. All these things wind up
in the graveyard of impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and not-self, so
don’t possessively cling to any of them. This is the cremation ground of
all phenomena. Bury and cremate them in order to experience the Truth.

Having insight into impermanence means not allowing ourselves to
suffer. It’s a matter of investigating with wisdom. For example, we obtain
something we consider good or pleasurable, and so we’re happy. Take a
close and sustained look at this goodness and pleasure. Sometimes after
having it for a long time we get fed up with it. We want to give it away
or sell it. If there’s nobody who wants to buy it, we’re ready to throw it
away. Why? What are the reasons underlying this dynamic? Everything
is impermanent, inconstant, and changing, that’s why. If we can’t sell it
or even throw it away, we start to suffer. This entire issue is just like that,
and once one incident is fully understood, no matter how many more
similar situations arise, they are all understood to be just the same. That’s
simply the way things are. As the saying goes, ‘If you’ve seen one,
you’ve seen them all.’

Occasionally we see things we don’t like. At times we hear annoying or
unpleasant noises and get irritated. Examine this and remember it,
because some time in the future we might like those noises. We might
actually delight in those very same things we once detested. It’s possible!
Then it occurs to us with clarity and insight, ‘Aha! All things are
impermanent, unable to fully satisfy, and not-self.’ Throw them into the
mass grave of these universal characteristics. The clinging to the likeable
things we get, have, and are, will then cease. We come to see everything
as essentially the same. Everything we then experience generates insight
into the Dhamma.

Everything I’ve said so far is simply for you to listen to and think about.
It’s just talk, that’s all. When people come to see me, I speak. These sorts
of subjects aren’t the things we should sit around and gab about for
hours. Just do it. Get in there and do it. It’s like when we call a friend to
go somewhere. We invite them. We get an answer. Then we’re off,
without a big fuss. We say just the right amount and leave it at that. I can
tell you a thing or two about meditation, because I’ve done the work. But
you know, maybe I’m wrong. Your job is to investigate and find out for
yourself if what I say is true.

constitutes the first meditation technique taught to a newly ordained
monk or nun by their preceptor.
